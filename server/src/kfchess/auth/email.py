"""Email sending functionality using Resend.

Handles verification and password reset emails. Falls back to console
output in development when Resend is not configured.

Email sending is done in a thread pool to avoid blocking the event loop,
since the Resend SDK uses synchronous HTTP calls.

Email failures are logged but not raised - this prevents registration
and password reset flows from failing due to email service issues.
Users can request new emails if needed.
